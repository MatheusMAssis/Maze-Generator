# Maze-Generator

In a one-day work, using a Randomized Prim's Algorithm, I created a maze generator. To use this generator, you just got to use your favorite IDE that supports matplotlib.pyplot and run this code as { make-maze(x, y) | x = width, y = length }. It will return a plot of the maze.

The code is very efficient, even with large mazes. It also has a plot using matplotlib.pyplot. This is a work in progress, as I'm going to make a A* search Algorithm to find the shortest path in this maze and color it.
