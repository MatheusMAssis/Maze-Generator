# Maze-Generator

Using a Randomized Prim's Algorithm, I created a maze generator. It was a one day work.

The code is very efficient, even with large mazes. It also has a plot using matplotlib.pyplot. This is a work in progress, as I'm going to make a A* search Algorithm to find the shortest path in this maze and color it.
